# Nutrition Label | FCC Responsive Web Design Certification

**Project 8/20**

This project recreates a realistic nutrition label using only HTML and CSS 🥣. It's a pixel-perfect layout mimicking the structure and spacing of labels found on food packaging. The challenge was all about precision, spacing, and mastering layout techniques using plain CSS 💪.
